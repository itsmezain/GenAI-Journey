    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🟢 **Part 1: Fundamentals of LangChain**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Will Learn:**  \n",
    "✅ Understanding how LangChain works.  \n",
    "✅ Setting up and using different LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, Ollama).  \n",
    "✅ Working with prompts using **PromptTemplates**.  \n",
    "✅ Managing memory for conversations.  \n",
    "✅ Connecting LangChain with **APIs, vector databases, and tools**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Important:**  \n",

    "✅ How to **fetch private/custom data** for LLMs.  \n",
    "✅ Storing and retrieving information using **Vector Databases**.  \n",
    "✅ Improving responses by integrating **external knowledge sources**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Important:**  \n",
    "LLMs like GPT **don’t have real-time knowledge** and can’t access private data. **RAG allows us to enhance AI responses** by enabling models to pull in up-to-date or **domain-specific information**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example:** Making a chatbot that **answers questions about your company’s internal documents** instead of just relying on pre-trained knowledge.  \n",

    "✅ Automating complex workflows using **LangChain Agents**.  \n",
    "✅ Implementing multi-step decision-making using **Agent Executors**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why It’s Important:**  \n",
    "A chatbot **just answers questions**, but an AI Agent can **take actions**. Agents can **call APIs, book tickets, send emails, analyze data**, and more. This is a game-changer for AI automation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example:** A chatbot that not only suggests **hotels in Goa** but also **books a room for you** using APIs like Booking.com.  \n",
